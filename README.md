## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Petras, a passionate and certified cybersecurity professional blending practical skills in **ethical hacking**, **SOC operations**, and **penetration testing**. With 2+ years of experience in **lab environments** and **hands-on simulations**, I focus on helping teams detect threats, secure networks, and build resilient systems.

🎓 I’m currently pursuing a **BSc in Cybersecurity** at Bath Spa University (RAK, UAE), while actively working on real-world projects and upskilling through **TryHackMe**, **Hack The Box**, and **EC-Council iLabs**.

⚡ **Next Step?** I’m beginning **CompTIA CySA+ training** to sharpen my skills as a SOC Analyst — diving deeper into **threat detection**, **incident response**, and **hands-on security operations** to stand out in today’s competitive job market.

> 🔄 Waiting for EC-Council Lab access reactivation to complete CEH & SOC Analyst labs. Meanwhile, progressing through TryHackMe Blue/Red Team paths and launching new labs.
